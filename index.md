## How to read the cards?

A lot of people use tarot as a tool for self discovery and meditation. We will not provide a list of meaning to the cards here. There is plenty of this on the web. You certainly can find it very quickly if you try. I suggest you to learn to read by yourself. Understand the meanings, the symbology, then add your intuition and it's done! Maybe you could start [here](http://learntarot.com/).
